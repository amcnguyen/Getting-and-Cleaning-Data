***

## Purpose of document:

Describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data .

***

## Process Description:

1. Merge the training and the test datasets to create one dataset.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names. 
5. From step 4, create a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

***

## Data File Description: 

Submit the link to a Github repository that contains the following items:

1. Create a tidy data set that can be used for analysis
2. Upload the dataset as a .txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE

## Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
